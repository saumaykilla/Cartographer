## Overview
The "Survival Mode" feature. Integrating the camera and real-time computer vision for in-store assistance.

## Tasks
1. **Camera HUD**
   - [ ] Build camera interface with minimalist HUD.
   - [ ] Implement object detection frame capture (local or cloud-triggered).

2. **Vision-AI Integration**
   - [ ] Connect to Gemini Multimodal Live API (Vertex AI) for low-latency scanning.
   - [ ] Pass user profile (Origin/Language) as context for every scan.

3. **AR Overlay UI**
